This site contains bulk write ups from CTFs that I've competed in with the team [BYU Cyberia](https://ctftime.org/team/155711). The format of this home page includes a highlighted recent CTF I did as well as links to all challenge write ups by category

Note: if you're trying to get started in CTFs, check out my [resources page](./resources.md)! It's a list of all the stuff I've ever seen (and that looks semi-decent) as far as learning CTFs goes. Feel free to reach out to me about any of them (though if it says "potentially" I probably haven't personally used it)

### Most Recent CTF

I played DiceCTF in March 2025 with [Monosodium Glutamate; Or, the Best Team](https://ctftime.org/team/379366), and we placed 8th in the US Undergrad division. There were a lot of fun RE challenges, but I've only written up [Debgalyzer](./RE/debugalyzer/) thus far. It's a neat challenge tho, so you should check it out.
