- [Blupper's blog](https://theblupper.github.io/blog/posts/lattices/) - a top-notch beginner's guide to lattices and lattice reduction
- [A Gentle Tutorial for Lattice-Based Cryptanalysis](https://github.com/josephsurin/lattice-based-cryptanalysis/blob/main/tutorial.pdf) - second step after you know what a lattice is, goes further into depth
- [Cryptography 101](https://cryptography101.ca/) - lots of great tutorials / articles on cryptography (includes a lot of newer algorithms and methods fro post-quantum era cryptography)

### Web
- [PortSwigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) - gold standard for web education

### Forensics
- [Forensics](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/forensics/index.html) - opinion-heavy, but actually a good beginner forensics resource
- [THM Advent of Cyber 2023](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/adventofcyber2023) - okay hear me out, just go and do Day 7 "'Tis the season for log chopping". It taught me everything I know about command line log forensics, and I would recommend it to anyone
